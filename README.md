This project will create a game that will allow multiple users to play. Each user will have a UFO that they will be playing with and their goal will be to be the last surviving UFO. Each person is allowed to customize there UFO by picking a class and ability. Once the game starts the UFO's will shoot astroids to gain cash, this cash can be spent for speed or gun upgrades. Once there is only one UFO left the game ends and you will be brought to the scoreboard.

## The technologies that we will be using include:
1. Node.js
2. React Native
3. Express
4. p5.js
5. Socket.io
6. Heroku
7. MongoDB
