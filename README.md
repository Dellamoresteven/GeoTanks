This project will create a game that will allow multiple users to play. Each user will have a GeoTank that they will be playing with and their goal will be to be the last surviving GeoTank. Each GeoTank is made up of a grid of tiles, random upgrades will spawn across the GeoTank arena, that can be picked up and added to a user's GeoTank. From here, each user will try to destroy the other GeoTanks to be the last one standing.

## The technologies that we will be using include:
1. Node.js
2. React Native
3. Express
4. p5.js
5. Socket.io
6. Heroku
7. MongoDB
